# Introduction
This repository contains all the lab works I performed for my Computer Vision course. They're here to serve as a record of my skills in opencv, pytorch and other image processing libraries.

# Lab Works
In this section, I'll note down a brief overview of each lab.

### Lab 1
We learned how to manipulate tensors in PyTorch and calculate the dot and cross product. We also learned how to compute the gradient of a symbolic equation.

### Lab 2
This was a lab on Image Processing Basics. We learned to apply different kinds of filters (and how to upsample and downsample) using OpenCV's built-in functions.

### Lab 3
In this lab we learned how to create the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids of an image and use those (and a mask) for smooth blending of two images.

### Lab 4
We experimented with different masks and levels of a Laplacian pyramid while image blending.

### Lab 5
In this lab we applied filters again.

### Lab 6
Implementation of Canny Edge Detector Algorithm.

### Lab 7
Implementation of Histogram of Oriented Gradients feature extraction method.

### Lab 8/Mid
Implementation of SIFT Algorithm upto and not including feature refinement. Done in under an hour because of test constraints.

### Lab 9
Camera Calibration using OpenCV.

### Lab 10
Depth Measurement and Depth Map Visualization using OpenCV.

### Lab 11
Implementation of Shallow (KLT) and Dense (Horn-Schunck) Optical Flow Estimation.

### Lab 12
Segmentation of Images using YOLOV8 model.

### Lab 13
Real-time detection, classification and segmentation using YOLOV8 model.
