#Introduction
This repository contains all the lab works I performed for my Computer Vision course. They're here to serve as a record of my skills in opencv, pytorch and other image processing libraries.

#Lab Works
In this section, I'll note down a brief overview of each lab.

##Lab 1
We learned how to manipulate tensors in PyTorch and calculate the dot and cross product. We also learned how to compute the gradient of a symbolic equation.

##Lab 2
This was a lab on Image Processing Basics. We learned to apply different kinds of filters (and how to upsample and downsample) using OpenCV's built-in functions.
